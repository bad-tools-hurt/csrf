This repository contains the code, handouts, and lectures used in both studies, with all references to the authors and their institution(s) removed. We have removed code that is both irrelevant to the task and unique to the course. In particular, for this repository, we replaced a course-specific JSON library with a third-party library.

We provided a copy of CSRF Testing Tools ([`src/main/resources/WebPublic/CSRF-Testing-Tools/`](src/main/resources/WebPublic/CSRF-Testing-Tools/)) only to the "tool" groups in study 1 (TNX, TX).

We provided the JSRepl web app ([`src/main/java/edu/xxx/web/JavaScriptRepl.java`](src/main/java/edu/xxx/web/JavaScriptRepl.java) and [`src/main/resources/WebPublic/jsrepl.js`](src/main/resources/WebPublic/jsrepl.js)) only to the "example" groups in study 1 (NTX, TX) and to both groups in study 2.

The [`handouts/`](handouts/) directory contains the instructions given to each of the six participant groups. At the beginning of each study, we emailed the appropriate handout to each participant or pair of participants; the handouts were not part of the original repository.

The [`lectures/`](lectures/) directory contains the slides from the three lectures given during the week of the study for each year. These lectures provided introductions to JavaScript, web security, and web development. During each study, these slides were available via the course website for participants to review.
